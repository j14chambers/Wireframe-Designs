				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<div class="flex-container">
					<div class="flex-box">
						<p>As with the original game, the remake of Resident Evil 2 offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.
						<br>

						Similar to the "Scenario B" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a "2nd Run" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign. </p>
